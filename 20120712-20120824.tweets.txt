NBC will air their stupid pet doctor comedy show commercial free tomorrow, but not  distance events in T&amp;F and swimming #nbcfail
Platform diving is terrifying. Would you do a handstand at the edge, three stories up?
Wow, what a race, Mo Farah!!!!!
Nice, NBC cuts to commercial just as Mo Farrah makes his move #nbcfail
Umm I turned on NBC to watch the Olympics, instead I get the History Channel #nbcfail
Nice, NBC doesn't show distance events in T&amp;F w/o commercials either #nbcfail

@MichaelPhelps Thanks for the memories!
In a cruel twist of fate, my computer decides to crash while watching the BBC stream of swimming right before the Men's 4x100 IM relay.
@mikelgustafson 200M Free 2004 Athens, he didn't win gold, but what a stacked field and race!
I want to see Sun Yang and Katie Ledecky in a swim-off
Who is a bigger star in China right now? Sun Yang or Yao Ming?
The  team GBR IM really interview is pretty touching
The Terminator, Allison Schmitt up next
Russia is looking very strong, Soni in the lead!
Whoa - how tall is Gemma Spofforth?
Women's 4x100 IM relay  coming up next
Sun Yang pulling a Cesar Cielo. What a race!
Cochrane and Melloui in a fight for silver!
MP makes butterfly looks so easy
I love watching MP's streamlines off the wall!
20 and counting !!!!!
Lochte vs. Phelps: The final chapter
Damn, I really wanted Lochte get that gold. But congrats Tyler Clary
I'm waiting for NBC to show table tennis in primetime.
@mikelgustafson Usain Bolt swims the 100M!
I want @SamuelLJackson to do poolside interviews instead of Andrea Kremer.
Wow! Rebecca Soni destroyed her own WR!!!
These Arena suits are bright! Lets go Soni!

I spoke to soon, they showed 30secs of the medal ceremony. MP shed a tear.
@reezy_nation instead Bob Costas does his best Andrea Kremer impersonation in that interview
Why didn't NBC show the relay medal ceremony? This Bob Costas interview is atrocious #nbcfail
I wish NBC would show judo or weightlifting during primetime
That was  race was painful to watch
MP is the Greatest Olympian of All Time.
Michael Phelps Menʼs 4x200m Freestyle Relay, Swimming, July 31.  http://t.co/dFfRiYOS - that's the happiest pic I've seen of him in a while!
@reezy_nation Word. NBC better show the men's 100 back
Andrea Kremer please learn how to ask better questions #nbcfail
@njbrideau I'm jealous you get BBC coverage! NBC is awful
@alanabrahamson Thoman's a Wildcat too, just the kind that went to @UofA! #BearDown
@njbrideau French swimming team is very impressive!
Tall swimmers rock! @MattGrevers for the gold in 100M back! @Nick_Thoman  for the sliver! Americans 1-2!
Pressure? That's something you put in tires. Missy Franklin wins gold 14 minutes after a semifinal race
But Agnel is swimming out of this world right now...
The decision to put Lochte on the relay yesterday  is looking even more foolish now.
Yannick Agnel is a speed demon.
Battle of the Titans in backstroke today: 6'7'' @CamLacourt vs 6'8'' @MattGrevers. Grevers for the win, with a WR.
Wow, @Nathangadrian makes @MichaelPhelps look short!
MP just redeemed himself with that race after that disaster last night
Dude, what happened to the Aussies in that relay!?
@Nathangadrian sinks the Missile in leading off the relay!
Lochte is a beast, but a lot of second guessing going to happen by not swimming Grevers ....
What a race! @MichaelPhelps splits a 47.1! But France exacts revenge by out-touching Lochte
Oh boy! Here we go, Mens' 4x100 Free Relay!
@reezy_nation, @goldmedalmel  where can you find the  BBC internet stream?
Even if Lochte is in the 4x100 relay, its going to take a lot to upset the Aussies: http://t.co/Z3vWUrQe
